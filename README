Eclipse Jar Directory
=====================

This is a simple plugin that enables a feature which Eclipse should have had
all along: the ability to have a directory full of .jar files used as a 
library (in Eclipse parlance) without having to manually delete and re-create
the library every time a .jar changes.

I wrote this for myself, so it's a little sparse on testing or error checking,
but it should work for you too.

You may build this yourself if you wish. For convenience I've put a built
version on Github, though I make no promises about when it's built or from
what version of the code.
